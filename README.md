## Local dev setup
To run in dev mode you need to launch server, client and ui.  
Each folder contains makefile, to run in dev mode - execute `make dev`.
Do not forget to update your rust - `rustup update`.
Both server and client are using `cargo-watch` tool, which could be installed via `cargo install cargo-watch`.
